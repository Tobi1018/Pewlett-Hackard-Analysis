# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

In this project, we were tasked to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, provide a report that summarizes the analysis and helps prepare managers for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.
