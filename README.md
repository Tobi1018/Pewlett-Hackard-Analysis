# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

In this project, we were tasked to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, provide a report that summarizes the analysis and helps prepare managers for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.


## Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title.

Created SQL queries of a  Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955. Because some employees may have multiple titles in the database—for instance, due to promotions—Make use of the (DISTINCT ON) statement to create a table that contains the most recent title of each employee. Furthermore, used the COUNT() function to create a final table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title.
